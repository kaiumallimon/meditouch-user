  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/lottie/
    - assets/svg/
    - .env

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SF-Pro-Text
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-SemiBold.otf
          weight: 600
